- Latest Decision: **DEC-20250913-scanners-semgrep-1f592023**  
  State: **accepted**  
  When: **2025-09-13**  
  Authority: **assistant**  
  Importance score: **90.5**  

The latest decision for aspect 'scanners.semgrep' is accepted as of 2025-09-13 by assistant. The choice emphasizes avoid IDE lock-in, governance/adapters, low lock-in, mpi emphasized, parallel/time caps, security gates. Expected impact is a more reliable pipeline, simpler reviews, and easier CI enforcement. Alternatives considered included safe, reproducible operations in a local workspace as preferred variants during discussion. Evaluation used a rubric favoring cohesion, mpi within MPI constraints. This decision relates to ci.gates, cli.surface, docs.resolver, generator.loop, governance.versioning, iast.interface, ide.integration, lessons.mcp, normalization.schema, perf.parallelism, report.formats, sbom.cyclonedx, security.logging, tests.runner, workspace.paths and should be read alongside those aspects. Success will be measured by compile-green builds, passing acceptance checks, and reduced regressions.

Keep `/var/security` opt-in. - Changes - `config.py`: set `DEFAULT_CONFIG["out_dir"] = ".genticode"`. - `path
- 2025-09-12 **DEC-20250912-ci-gates-6be3dd45** [split merge] — Yes. Move everything into `.genticode/` at repo root. What stays in `/var`? - Nothing by default. Keep `/var/security` only as an opt-in `--out` or config override for special hosts that want repo-external persistence. Otherwise remove it f
- 2025-09-12 **DEC-20250912-ci-gates-af52b4fe** [merge] — Recommended folder name - Use `security/` at repo root. Clear purpose. Cross-platform. Easy to `.gitignore`. - Secondary choice: `.genticode/` with subfolders `raw/ reports/ compare/`. Keeps noise hidden. - Avoid `/log` not specific. Avoid
- 2025-09-12 **DEC-20250912-ci-gates-f8ab4ff0** [split] — It sounds like we should have chosen a different folder name than /var/ and probably shouldn't be using standard GNU folders in general. How about /log /var_genti /devlog ? I want a name that's meaningful and typical for its purpose. How wo
- 2025-09-12 **DEC-20250912-ci-gates-110f867a** [split merge] — Portability of `/var/security` vs `./security` - `/var/security` is Linux-specific and often unwritable without sudo. Breaks on Windows and some macOS setups. CI runners disallow writing to `/var` by default. - `./security` works everywhere
- 2025-09-12 **DEC-20250912-ci-gates-71e74265** [split merge] — What specific portability would be support by moving /var/security? It's in /var since that folder is protected from git allowing it to preserve state across git resets and we would add /security to get the same treatment, but if this folde
- 2025-09-12 **DEC-20250912-ci-gates-c085fcc1** [split merge] — Top gaps and likely changes: Architecture - Move artifacts default from `/var/security` to `./security` for portability. Keep `/var/security` as opt-in. - Add structured logging levels and quiet mode for CI. - Add a JSON schema for `finding

- 2025-09-11 **DEC-20250911-ci-gates-bd3082d5** [split merge] — Yes. Add a CI-agnostic “security jobs” layer with age-based prompts and MCP tools. Add Semgrep now. # What to add - **Config:** `.genticode/security.yml` with thresholds and commands. - **CLI:** `tools/sec_status.py` and `tools/sec_run.py`.
- 2025-09-11 **DEC-20250911-ci-gates-0dabb254** [split merge] — Can we make SAST/IAST and SBOM checks specifically easy to automate with a tool like Jenkins to run a nightly job? I'm thinking we might have some mechanism that checks the date and age of SAST/IAST and SBOM checks and asks the user if they

MCP server, prompt-iteration, router, quickcheck/timeout, replanning guard, and hardening are in place. Ready to move on. # What developers complain about - **“Almost-right” code → rework tax.*
- 2025-09-11 **DEC-20250911-ci-gates-26582402** [split merge] — Treat timeouts as prompt failures. Replan fast, with a minimal “go/no-go” check before reprompting. ## Policy - **Wall clock limit:** `GENTI_MAX_WALL_MIN=30` default. Timeout ⇒ prompt failed due to scope/complexity. - **Quickcheck budget:**

- 2025-09-11 **DEC-20250911-ci-gates-89d30299** [split merge] — Yes. A small, multipurpose MCP server helps in four high-leverage areas while CI remains the enforcer. ## Where MCP helps - **Prompt iteration automation.** Tool to build the reviewer prompt from `git diff` + gate outputs, parse the reply,
- 2025-09-11 **DEC-20250911-ci-gates-bc467a99** [split merge] — Possible, with trade-offs. ## What you’d lose - **Hard CI enforcement.** MCP can’t block merges. Keep GitHub Actions for gates and branch protection. MCP can only run local checks. citeturn0search10 - **Background/scheduled runs.** MCP i

- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-ci-gates-5a29eef6** [split merge] — Use automation, not an allowlist. ## Lightweight substitute for Context7 - **Local symbol index.** On CI or pre-commit, crawl changed files, collect imported names, then auto-index installed packages: - Build from PEP 561 stubs and stdlib *
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-ci-gates-222cd96d** [split merge] — Short answer: not yet. Today it validates PRD/PRIORITY, checks feature-to-code mapping, blocks out-of-scope changes, runs contract tests, and flags unexpected files. It does not detect duplicate code or enforce secure coding. Add these gate

What changed - `tools/feature_map_gate.py`: checks each selected feature in `slate.json` against `features.map.yaml`. Fails only if a selected feature marked `required:true` has no matching code files. Warns if a mapping
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-ci-gates-be1f6744** [split merge] — Yes. We dropped the Cursor Rules. No global SSOT.

- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-ci-gates-6f66f818** [split merge] — Short answer: we built a brittle platform veneer with high surface area and low payoff. What’s wrong - Wrong abstraction. “Packs” still rely on repo-relative scripts and paths. No real packaging, version registry, or isolation. - Security t
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-ci-gates-f3ea5d90** [split merge] — Complete. Added now - Engine–pack compatibility. Pack manifest declares `engine: ">=0.1.0 <0.2.0"`.

No behavior change. 2) Core CLI. Add a minimal `genti` wrapper that reads `genti.yaml` and calls current scripts. 3) Pack extractio
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-ci-gates-a4fedf51** [split merge] — Keep them separate. Ship Genticode as a **pack** on top of Genticore. No monolith. What Genticode contains after factoring - Schemas: `prd-1.2.json`, `priority-1.0.json`, OpenAPI/SLO templates. - Mappers: PRD → test skeletons, PRIORITY → sl
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-ci-gates-096743af** [split merge] — Yes. Genticore is a general substrate: schemas → plans → checks → gates. Reusable across domains. ## What Genticore is - **Artifacts:** JSON-Schema’d files with `$schema` pins (e.g., PRD, PRIORITY, SLO, Contract). - **Slate engine:** ABC-12
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-ci-gates-f8055346** [split merge] — Short answer: keep planning, contracts, and test discipline. Drop PRD-as-SSOT. Add reverse-engineering, fitness functions, and behavior capture. # What adapts well to existing code - **PRIORITY.yaml** for release slates. No code changes req
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-ci-gates-b55bd55e** [split merge] — No. Removing the field is necessary but insufficient. Do these moves: 1) Schema hard-ban - Bump to `schemas/prd-1.2.json`. Delete the `augmentations` property. Keep `additionalProperties: false`. Any PRD with `augmentations` now fails valid
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-ci-gates-d9af9737** [split merge] — Kill **augmentations** now and make `PRIORITY.yaml` the single source of truth. Why it’s the biggest problem - Two priority systems coexist. Drift is guaranteed. - Augmentations mutate spec semantics and enable hidden overrides. - Plans can
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-ci-gates-c5810622** [split merge] — Confirmed. Next moves to lock in the ABC-123 slate without adding friction: 1) Schema + linter - Add `schemas/priority-1.0.json` with enums for `rank` ∈ {A1,A2,A3,B1,B2,B3,C1,C2,C3}, `badges` ∈ {MUST,DEP,RISK}, `effort` ∈ {S,M,L,XL}. - Pre-
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-ci-gates-a33254b5** [split merge] — Recommendation: switch `PRIORITY.yaml` to an ABC-123, badge-based, self-documenting layout. Human scans it without docs. CI maps codes to numbers. # Format ```yaml release: "2025.10" capacity: 80 legend: rank: "A1..C3 (A=highest class, 1=to

- 2025-09-11 **DEC-20250911-normalization-schema-38489ad8** [split merge] — Use a light, automatable SDLC gate at PR time, plus nightly drift checks. Rationale: maximize traceability and risk control with minimal developer friction. ## PR-time SDLC gates (block merge) - **PRD/CONTRACT anchors present.** Enforce hea
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-75c6a3cc** [split merge] — Use a **fan-out → normalize → wait/merge → judge** pattern. Concrete n8n layout: 1) **Trigger** `Webhook` (or `Manual Trigger`). 2) **Get Case JSON** `HTTP Request` → returns the case payload. If your API returns an array, normalize next. 3
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-df651dff** [split merge] — Yes. The judge can score using only the **canonical milestones (CMS)** and the **normalized plan**. Use this updated system prompt: # Judge — Plan vs CMS → Percent Done You score how far an ordered troubleshooting plan would push a case tow

They assume: - **Fresh case** = same JSON with `Case.activities` removed. - **Solved history** = same JSON with `Case.activities` present. - Milestones use **equal weight*
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-3559da7f** [split merge] — New design: outcome-based, LLM-judged “percent done.” No effort guesses. LLM does all mapping. # Pipeline 1) **Inputs** - `fresh_case` (you already rewind it). - `solved_case_history`. 2) **Extract Minimal Sufficient Requirements (MSR) from
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-51042426** [split merge] — Short answer: Build a repeatable offline “case rewind → prompt → judge” loop with a canonical step graph, effort weights, and a precision-recall-plus-efficiency score. Credit leapfrogs. Penalize spam. Output a single percentage with a break
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-8a56d444** [split merge] — Correct. There is no global SSOT now. What exists - Editor-agnostic core. The CLI works without Cursor or VS Code. The webview is optional. - “Intent SSOT”: `PRD.md` front-matter + `PRIORITY.yaml` are the truth for selection inputs. - “Plan

- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-b517906d** [split merge] — Yes. Keep a tight MVP for Cursor with a webview UI. Cut the rest. ### Remove now - Packs and runners. One repo, one CLI. - Dockerfiles, `upgrade` command, allow-list machinery. - TUI editors (`form_wizard.py`, `schema_form.py`). - Homegrown
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-57ccf204** [split merge] — Useful, but only as a starter and teaching scaffold. It’s fine for demos, small repos, and as a place to hang real checks. It is not production-grade. How it should have been done - Ship one killer gate first. Example: “OpenAPI + consumer t
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-ed9e92c6** [split merge] — Short answer: we built a brittle platform veneer with high surface area and low payoff. What’s wrong - Wrong abstraction. “Packs” still rely on repo-relative scripts and paths. No real packaging, version registry, or isolation. - Security t
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-638b68b3** [split merge] — Done. Changes - Manifest now declares runners. Mappers use `runner: python`.

- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-d2ad2b9b** [split merge] — Complete. Added now - Engine–pack compatibility. Pack manifest declares `engine: ">=0.1.0 <0.2.0"`. CLI enforces and writes `.genticore/packs.lock`. - Unified report and PR comment retained. Gates hardened: pack Python tools only; external
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-bdb6ce02** [split merge] — Done. The planned steps are complete. What to tighten next for coherence - Single source of schemas Problem: duplicates at repo root and under `packs/genticode/`. Fix: delete top-level `schemas/` and `tools/` copies. Ensure all references p

- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-101e62e0** [split merge] — Plan: 1) Docs + scaffolding. Add top-level README, `genti.yaml`, and a `packs/genticode/manifest.yaml` stub. No behavior change. 2) Core CLI. Add a minimal `genti` wrapper that reads `genti.yaml` and calls current scripts. 3) Pack extractio
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-407d1517** [split merge] — Keep them separate. Ship Genticode as a **pack** on top of Genticore. No monolith. What Genticode contains after factoring - Schemas: `prd-1.2.json`, `priority-1.0.json`, OpenAPI/SLO templates. - Mappers: PRD → test skeletons, PRIORITY → sl
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-e53e1f8a** [split merge] — Yes. Genticore is a general substrate: schemas → plans → checks → gates. Reusable across domains. ## What Genticore is - **Artifacts:** JSON-Schema’d files with `$schema` pins (e.g., PRD, PRIORITY, SLO, Contract). - **Slate engine:** ABC-12
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-25662a9f** [split merge] — Short answer: keep planning, contracts, and test discipline. Drop PRD-as-SSOT. Add reverse-engineering, fitness functions, and behavior capture. # What adapts well to existing code - **PRIORITY.yaml** for release slates. No code changes req
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-130b521a** [split merge] — No. Removing the field is necessary but insufficient. Do these moves: 1) Schema hard-ban - Bump to `schemas/prd-1.2.json`. Delete the `augmentations` property. Keep `additionalProperties: false`. Any PRD with `augmentations` now fails valid
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-5758e5ee** [split merge] — Kill **augmentations** now and make `PRIORITY.yaml` the single source of truth. Why it’s the biggest problem - Two priority systems coexist. Drift is guaranteed. - Augmentations mutate spec semantics and enable hidden overrides. - Plans can
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-22ac2ae0** [split merge] — Confirmed. Next moves to lock in the ABC-123 slate without adding friction: 1) Schema + linter - Add `schemas/priority-1.0.json` with enums for `rank` ∈ {A1,A2,A3,B1,B2,B3,C1,C2,C3}, `badges` ∈ {MUST,DEP,RISK}, `effort` ∈ {S,M,L,XL}. - Pre-
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-a2234ece** [split merge] — Recommendation: switch `PRIORITY.yaml` to an ABC-123, badge-based, self-documenting layout. Human scans it without docs. CI maps codes to numbers. # Format ```yaml release: "2025.10" capacity: 80 legend: rank: "A1..C3 (A=highest class, 1=to

No dot-path overrides. - Why: Removes hidden side effe
- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-21ca9e27** [split merge] — Make it one-command and front-load automation. I built it.

- 2025-09-10 **DEC-20250910-normalization-schema-1ebfd154** [merge] — Short version: high ceremony, brittle routing, schema checks shape not truth. Augmentations invite conflict and gaming. The PRD can steer the agent, which is unsafe. Expect drift, misprioritization, and “spec theater.” ## Core flaws - **Val
- 2025-09-09 **DEC-20250909-normalization-schema-ba3e22eb** [split] — I think the Dual-file approach would be better since this affords developers simple access to the JSON schema to use externally. It also allows for programmatic validation without expecting the LLM to do it which we might add in the future.

- 2025-08-11 **DEC-20250811-tests-runner-0ad5a4bf** [split merge] — Root cause: the app’s metrics router depends on `verify_bearer` from `innerloop.api.middleware.auth`, but that module doesn’t exist yet. We fixed earlier missing modules; this is the same pattern: a missing file that bootstrapping imports.
